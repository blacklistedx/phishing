Implementing a comprehensive solution for detecting phishing email scams in an Office 365 inbox, incorporating UID tracking, website cloning detection, and notifications, is a complex task that exceeds the scope of a single code example. Such a system would require integration with various APIs, external services, and sophisticated algorithms. Here's a high-level overview of how you might structure such a system, along with code snippets illustrating key components:

Please note that this example is highly simplified and serves as a conceptual outline. A production-ready system would require a substantial development effort, integration with Office 365 APIs, and likely the use of specialized email security tools and services.

In this simplified example:

    We simulate fetching emails for multiple users and analyze email content for phishing indicators.
    We track user behavior and maintain a history of website snapshots for each user.
    We periodically check for website cloning by comparing the current website content with historical snapshots.
    If phishing emails or website cloning is detected, we send simulated alerts.

Please note that this example is for conceptual purposes and does not include complete implementations of phishing detection, web scraping, or webhook integration. A production-ready system would require integration with Office 365 APIs, advanced phishing detection techniques, and a more robust alerting mechanism.
