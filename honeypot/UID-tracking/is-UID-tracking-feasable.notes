UID (User ID) tracking can be a valuable component in email security and phishing detection systems, but its feasibility, automation level, and integration with management consoles depend on the capabilities of the specific email security solution you are using. Here are some considerations:

    Feasibility: UID tracking is feasible and can provide valuable insights into email security incidents. By tracking the behavior and activities associated with specific user accounts, you can identify unusual patterns or potential threats. However, implementing UID tracking often requires access to email logs and metadata, which may not be available in all email environments.

    Automation Level: The level of automation in UID tracking can vary. Some email security solutions provide automated tracking and analysis of user behavior, while others may require manual configuration and monitoring. The level of automation depends on the sophistication of the solution you choose.

    Value to Email Administrator: UID tracking can provide significant value to email administrators by helping them detect and respond to email security incidents more effectively. It can help administrators identify compromised accounts, detect insider threats, and monitor for unusual email activity.

    Management Console Perspective: From a management console perspective, UID tracking typically involves the following:
        User Activity Logs: Access to logs that record user email activity, including sent, received, and actions taken on emails (e.g., opening attachments, clicking links).
        Behavioral Analysis: Tools and features that analyze user behavior for anomalies and suspicious patterns.
        Alerting and Reporting: The ability to set up alerts and generate reports based on detected anomalies or policy violations associated with user accounts.
        Policy Configuration: The ability to configure policies that govern user behavior and trigger alerts or actions based on policy violations.

    Policy Settings and Alerts: UID tracking can be integrated into email security policies. For example, you can set up policies that trigger alerts or actions when a user account exhibits unusual behavior, such as sending a high volume of emails to external domains or clicking on potentially malicious links. Policy violations can result in automated alerts or remediation actions.

    Intelligence in Conviction Decision: Some advanced email security solutions incorporate user behavior analysis and UID tracking into their decision-making processes. For example, if an email from a known sender contains a link to a potentially malicious website, the system may assess the recipient's previous behavior and trustworthiness when deciding whether to deliver the email or quarantine it.

Ultimately, the feasibility and level of automation for UID tracking depend on the capabilities of your chosen email security solution.
