//Detecting phishing attacks within an Office 365 inbox involves leveraging the platform's built-in security features and potentially enhancing them with additional customizations. Here's a simplified overview of the steps and considerations for detecting phishing attacks within an Office 365 inbox:

    Office 365 Security Features:
        Make sure that Office 365's built-in security features, such as Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), are properly configured and up to date.
        Enable features like Safe Links and Safe Attachments, which can help identify and block malicious links and attachments.

    Email Filtering and Classification:
        Configure email filtering rules to categorize incoming emails based on their characteristics.
        Use built-in classifiers to identify known phishing emails.

    Machine Learning and Behavioral Analysis:
        Leverage Office 365's machine learning capabilities to detect unusual email behavior patterns.
        Monitor user activity and identify deviations from normal behavior.

    Anti-Phishing Policies:
        Implement anti-phishing policies that include customized rules and conditions for detecting phishing emails.
        Consider creating policies that check for common phishing indicators, such as suspicious sender domains, keywords, or attachment types.

    User Education and Training:
        Educate Office 365 users about the risks of phishing attacks and provide guidance on how to recognize and report suspicious emails.
        Encourage users to be cautious with emails containing links or attachments, especially if they're unexpected or from unknown senders.

    Phishing Simulation Exercises:
        Conduct phishing simulation exercises to assess how well users can identify phishing attempts.
        Use the results to tailor training and awareness efforts.

    Email Quarantine and Reporting:
        Implement an email quarantine system where potentially suspicious emails are held for further analysis.
        Allow users to report suspicious emails easily, which can aid in identifying emerging threats.

    Threat Intelligence Feeds:
        Integrate threat intelligence feeds into Office 365 to receive real-time information on known phishing threats.
        Use this data to enhance your email filtering and detection capabilities.

    Incident Response Plan:
        Develop a comprehensive incident response plan specific to phishing attacks.
        Define procedures for investigating, mitigating, and recovering from phishing incidents.

    Regular Updates and Monitoring:
        Keep Office 365 and security configurations up to date with the latest patches and updates.
        Continuously monitor email traffic and security logs for suspicious activity.

    Third-Party Solutions:
        Consider using third-party email security solutions that can provide additional layers of protection, such as advanced threat detection and user behavior analysis.

//In our case see phish-detection.c++ as a possible third party solution to solve detection.
