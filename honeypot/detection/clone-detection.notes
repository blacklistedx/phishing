//Detecting mass-scale phishing attacks where a company's website is being cloned can be a challenging task, and it typically requires a combination of various techniques and tools beyond what can be implemented in a C++ program alone. However, I can provide you with a high-level overview of the steps involved and the types of technologies you might use to implement such a detection system:

    Web Scraping and Monitoring:
        Develop a web scraping component in your code to periodically fetch the company's website content. You can use C++ libraries like libcurl for this purpose.
        Store snapshots of the website content at regular intervals.

    Content Comparison:
        Implement a mechanism to compare the current website content with historical snapshots.
        Use text and image analysis to detect similarities between the real website and cloned versions.
        Employ algorithms that can identify text alterations, added forms, or malicious scripts on the cloned websites.

    Domain Monitoring:
        Monitor domain registrations and SSL certificates for domains that closely resemble the company's official domain.
        Implement DNS monitoring to detect newly registered domains resembling the company's domain.

    Machine Learning and Anomaly Detection:
        Train machine learning models to identify unusual patterns, such as a sudden increase in website clones or unexpected changes to website content.
        Utilize anomaly detection algorithms to flag potential phishing instances based on historical data.

    Network Traffic Analysis:
        Analyze network traffic logs for patterns indicating a widespread phishing campaign targeting your company.
        Look for unusual IP addresses or geolocations associated with phishing attacks.

    User Reporting:
        Encourage users and customers to report suspected phishing attempts.
        Implement an easy-to-use reporting mechanism on your website.

    Alerting and Notification:
        When a potential phishing attack is detected, trigger alerts or notifications to the company's security team.
        Include information about the suspected clones and the URLs involved.

    Incident Response Plan:
        Have a well-defined incident response plan in place to address detected phishing attacks promptly.
        Define procedures for takedown requests, legal actions, and public communication.

    Legal Action:
        Consider involving legal authorities or services to issue takedown notices for fraudulent domains.

    Continuous Monitoring:
        Continuously monitor website and domain activity to ensure ongoing protection against phishing attacks.
