//The peice of code seen in simplified c++ is an example of how you might approach analyzing emails in an Office 365 environment using the Microsoft Graph API. Please note that this example is very high-level and does not include specific code to detect phishing attacks, as that would require sophisticated analysis techniques and threat intelligence feeds, which are beyond the scope of a simple code snippet. Additionally, you'll need to integrate authentication and error handling for a complete solution.

//This code snippet makes a GET request to the user's inbox using the Microsoft Graph API. To analyze emails for potential phishing attacks, you would need to implement specific logic to examine the email content, sender, links, and attachments, among other things. Detecting phishing emails is a complex task that often involves machine learning and threat intelligence data.
